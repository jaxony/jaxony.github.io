title: I was an AI Grant Finalist!
---

I've been working on a side project that combines machine learning and augmented reality. It's a smart, virtual chess mentor. I recently applied for an [AI Grant](https://aigrant.org/) and was selected as a top 75 finalist out of nearly 900 submissions from around the world.

Unfortunately, I didn't win one of the 20 grants on offer. But I did spend a lot of effort to make this AI Grant Finalist video over a single weekend (we had a very short turnaround). I'm pretty proud of this video, mostly because of the cinematic shots, the effects and the nice 50mm lens which my friend Nitin lended to me. It'd be a waste if I didn't at least blog about it! :-)

I will update my blog with my app development adventures. Tune in soon!
