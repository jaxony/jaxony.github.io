title: My First Open Source Experience

![Python Trending Tweet](/images/python-trending-tweet.png "Thanks for the shoutout!")

Today I found out that my open source implementation of ShuffleNet, a highly efficient convolutional neural network, was shared on the Python Trending Twitter page because it had been getting some traction on the interwebs.

I'm super stoked to have gotten 36 stars and 7 forks (as of writing) for my first open source deep learning repository. It's awesome to feel that what I created with just me, myself and a keyboard is being used and modified for other cool projects all over the world... That's impact (however small)!

Onto the next open source project.
